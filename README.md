# BSV-TX-PREIMAGE-TUTORIAL

Herein I show how to create and use the preimage of a transaction in the BSV Blockchain. 

There is no easy docs availabe that clearly teaches the steps to create a transction preimage for the BSV Blockchain.

Therefore I will put here my experience of creating this structure and will try to keep it uptodated, following changes that may happens in the future.
